**USER STORIES**

- As a *librarian*, I need to check that every record of issuing and accepting borrowed books are maintained so that the library functions properly withut misplacement of books.
- As a *member*, I need to search and borrow books from the library so that I can use them to research for work or casually read them away from the library.
- As a *caretaker of the library*, I need to look after the maintainance of books so that my library can lend book to members in a good state.
- As a *non-member of the library*, I need to register myself to the library so that I can borrow books from there in the future.
